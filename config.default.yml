# server is a map containing the server config.
# - host configures the server address on which the server listens.
#   This can be a hostname, but this is not recommended because it will create a listener for at most one of the host's IP addresses.
#   If the parameter is left empty or a literal unspecified IP address, it will listen on all available unicast and anycast IP addresses of the local system.
# - port configures the port on which to listen. If the port is left empty or "0", a port number is automatically chosen.
server:
  host: ""
  port: 9988
